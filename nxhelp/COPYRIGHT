   Description: 
	NXHelp is a help facility that can easily be added to any
        Motif program. When activated, NXHelp displays an index of
        help topics. Once the user has chosen a topic, the text
        information on that topic is displayed.  Topics can also
	be selected from help callbacks within the application.

   Author's notes:
	Destined to be one day a global help facility for all programs
	incorporating this into their application.

   System Information:
        This text and code is based on the OSF/Motif widget set version
        1.1 and the X Window System version 4.

   About the NCSU Motif Group:
        The NCSU Motif Group is a group of students at North Carolina
        State University who meet once a week to discuss Motif programming.
        Individual projects are used to help students learn Motif. 
        These projects are then released onto the network to help others.
        All released code is available at our anonymous FTP site:
        osl.csc.ncsu.edu, in the directory pub/ncsu_motif.  Questions 
        and comments should be directed to the lead programmer for the 
        project in question, or to the faculty advisor, Marshall Brain, 
        at brain@eos.ncsu.edu.
